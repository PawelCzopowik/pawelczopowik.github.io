# Overview
Mizeria is a Polish cucumber, vinegar and sourcream salad, which commonly accompanies a meat-and-potatoes dish. It is also a "sur√≥wka" or a class of salads made of fresh vegetables and fruit, also typically a side dish to a dinner. 

# Theory
General concept is cucumbers with sourcream. Building on that we have salt and white vinegar. One can substitute vinegar with lemon juice. Very finely chopped white onion can be added as well as fresh dill. The cucumbers can be squeezed out of water by hand for a different variation (less watery, sloppy consistency). 

I found that using lemon juice and a bit of garlic emulates the taste of vinegar and results in a rich sour flavor, an alternative to those health conscious about consuming white vinegar. I do something in the middle, 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 lemon plus garlic.

The sourcream will become more runny as it mixes with the water the cucumbers release. Adjust how much water you keep to your liking, i prefer mine to be a little runny.

I prefer waiting for the salt and cucumbers to react where the slices get somewhat limp yet still crunchy, but some like to serve the cucumbers right away for the crunchiest slices.

I think its best if the salad gets time to blend flavors, so either rest as you're making or rest after making for about an hour.

# Ingredients
1. 3 cucumbers (roughly 850/750g unpeeled/peeled)
1. 8g kosher salt
1. 150g sour cream
1. ~30g white onion, finely chopped
1. ~3g minced garlic (half a tooth?)
1. 1 tbsp or 15ml lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)
1. 1 tbsp 15 15ml white vinegar 5%
1. Fresh pepper

# Process
Time: (30-60m) can be eaten right away, but its best when ingredients sit around a while, gets better the next day.
We slice the cucumbers and let sit with salt. Dressing is made separately and rests too.
No exceptional cases.

### Dressing
1. Mix sourcream, garlic, vinegar, lemon juice
1. Let stand for 30-60m, this is necessary for the garlic to develop flavor in the cream.

### Cucumbers
1. Slice cucumbers (peeling is up to your preference)
1. Add salt and mix thoroughly by hand with cucumbers.
1. If you want fresh and crunchy slices, don't wait, skip to mixing in the dressing, otherwise
1. Let sit for 30-60 min (can be in collander to drain) the salt, preferably kosher, helps to pull water out of cucumber.
1. Drain most of the water, unless you want it somewhat runny. (first time try draining majority of water)
1. Mix in dressing.
1. Add onion, dill or pepper if desired

# Consuming
Its great next to boiled potatoes as the sourcream dressing will blend nicely as the potatoes are crushed and mixed with it. Mashed potatoes too!
Best flavor is usually second to third day, but first day is also great.
Black pepper goes really well with this.
