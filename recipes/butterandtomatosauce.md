# Overview

They KEY to this recipe is SAN MARZANO tomatoes! Top quality butter and real parmigiano-reggiano cheese. Best ingredients you can get.

This is a simple yet delicious recipe and its simplicity is what makes it so amazing. One can add some heavy cream (or similar) and pepper flakes for an arrabiatta style.

Adding the cheese at the end cuts down on the acidity, but the cheese can be added to the pasta as its tossed with the sauce. I think adding it to the sauce is what makes it so wonderful (but some prefer the acidity)
