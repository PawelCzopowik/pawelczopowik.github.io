Rye bread by 2% calculation

1. 900g AP flour (or bread flour) - King Arthur
1. 300g whole wheat dark rye flour
1. 15g of vital wheat gluten if not using bread flour
1. 24g salt
1. 24g yeast
1. 24g olive oil

Dough temperature should end up being 24&deg;C +/- 1 deg
Split dough in 1/2 (should be about 1135g each) into two oiled bowls, cover.
Once risen, punch down and transfer to 2 baking pans that are oiled and covered in semolina (not cornmeal, it affects the flavor).
Bake 420&deg;F for 55-60 min. Should come out nice and dark which imparts flavor

Experiment with overnight/cold rise, should carmelize more.
