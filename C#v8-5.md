# PART III Object-Oriented Programming with C#
# CHAPTER 5 Understanding Encapsulation

## Constructors As Expression-Bodied Members (New 7.0)
Oneliner constructor
```c#
public Car(string pn) => petName = pn;
```

## Constructors with out Parameters (New 7.3)
```c#
public Car(string pn, int cs, out bool inDanger) {...}
```

## Chaining Constructor Calls Using this
- Use a function to validate, called by ctor
- Have a "master" constructor that does all the validation, chain the rest
- __Alternative is optional params (default values)__

```c#
class Motorcycle
{
  public int driverIntensity;
  public string driverName;
  
  // Constructor chaining.
  public Motorcycle() {}
  public Motorcycle(int intensity)
    : this(intensity, "") {}
  public Motorcycle(string name)
    : this(0, name) {}
  
  // This is the 'master' constructor that does all the real work.
  public Motorcycle(int intensity, string name)
  {
    if (intensity > 10)
    {
      intensity = 10;
    }
    driverIntensity = intensity;
    driverName = name;
  }
  ...
}
```

Optional arguments
```c#

class Motorcycle
{
  // Single constructor using optional args.
  public Motorcycle(int intensity = 0, string name = "")
  {
    if (intensity > 10)
    {
      intensity = 10;
    }
      driverIntensity = intensity;
      driverName = name;
    }
  ...
}
```

## Understanding the static Keyword
- Initialize static data so its set once, rather than on each constructor call
`public static double currInterestRate = 0.04;`

### Defining Static Constructors
- Simply put, a static constructor is a special constructor that is an ideal place to initialize the values of static data when the value is not known at compile time
   - A given class may define only a single static constructor. In other words, the static constructor cannot be overloaded.
   - A static constructor does not take an access modifier and cannot take any parameters.
   - A static constructor executes exactly one time, regardless of how many objects of the type are created.
   - The runtime invokes the static constructor when it creates an instance of the class or before accessing the first static member invoked by the caller.
   - The static constructor executes before any instance-level constructors.
